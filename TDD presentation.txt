- don't write production code unless there is a failing test
	- refactoring is fine, but shouldn't be done if there is no tests (e.g. legacy code)
- write minimal code to satisfy the test

- write minimal amount of tests which are necessary to fail

	- if you write a new test and it is passing, it means that it's not needed

	- if two tests are always failing together or always passing together, one of them is probably redudant

- always see the test fail and for the right reason

	- when writing tests for existing code, never change test to see it fail, break implementation instead

	- consider removing all implementation code and keep adding it back piece by piece, only what is needed for the test to pass
